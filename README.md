# 💃🏻 Kia ora, I'm Helena 💃🏻

Software Developer with a background in capital markets policy and retail and commercial banking.

I'm from Nelson, New Zealand and have spent three years in London. I love a new challenge and after walking the Camino this year I decided to embark on my coding journey to help people and make a postive impact. A recent graduate of a 15 week full stack software development bootcamp with Dev Academy, I have developled skills quickly in data algorithms, data structures, database design, testing, and more.

I joined GitHub in July, created my first HTML website in August [her journey into tech](https://helenaroughton.github.io/), and by December I built full stack websites with a database, [Book Recs](https://my-fullstack-collection-zpad.onrender.com/), used authentication, integrated APIs, testing, and worked with AI. My final group [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-xb2Gw1pV0) showcases these skills and great collaboration. 

## 💻 Projects and Learnings 💻

#### [Numbers Game](https://github.com/helenaroughton/numbers-game)
A number learning game for my young niece which has one learning level built with JavaScript.
My first solo project which I'm still developing but have already experienced two great learning and problem solving moments.\
\
**1. Code Structure:**\
Importance of finding a balance between "Separation of Concerns" and "Bundling". I had over separated components which made data management difficult. I struggled to connect the logic with the data and after comparing against other projects and guidance from Claude I realised I needed to adopt a more bundled approach to keep data and logic in the same component.\
\
**2. Product Development:**\
Vital to have regular check ins with the end user or customer of the product to ensure it remains fit for purpose and usable. My first iteration was too complex for the target user and after the second iteration, extra feedback led to valuable additions such as audio prompts and naming of animals for further development. I also learned not to over style too early and create significant re-work after user feedback. 


#### [Meet Me in the Middle](https://github.com/helenaroughton/meet-me) 
An app where the user can find the perfect place (park, cafe, bar, restaurant) to meet their friend in the middle of where they both live.\
\
I have had some valuable learnings in the planning stages:\
\
**1. Simple MVP vs Product Goal**\
I made a decision to focus on getting the simplest version to market to test the core concept as soon as possible over widening the practical use cases of the app before launching. This was a hard decision for me and I originally had many extra use cases and features I planned to include in the first MVP but after working through my project plan I realised I should focus on developing the simplest version first and have phases that follow. 

### Past Projects

#### [Book Recs](https://my-fullstack-collection-zpad.onrender.com/)
Book recommendations added by friends and family! First full stack web app with a database November 2025.

#### [her journey into tech](https://helenaroughton.github.io/)
My first html + CSS website (September 2025) with some technical blogs about my learning journey as well as more personal blogs about me. This showcases where I started and highlights my values and where I get my drive. 

#### Curately - [Final Group Project Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-xb2Gw1pV0)
Users can login and curate their own lists of anything they want to consume or recommend. Books, movies, restaurants, places, musc. Users can also explore a home page to find other user lists.
